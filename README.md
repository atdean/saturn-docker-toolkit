# Docker-based Saturn Homebrew Toolchain and Shell Project

### Purpose
This is a project to create a Docker-based build system and shell project for Sega Saturn homebrew. You put your needed libraries, source code, and assets into the appropriate folders and launch the container. It will use a pre-built Docker image (or build the image for you) that contains custom versions of GNU compiler tools targeting the SH-2 and M68K processors, as well as other other tools needed to generate a usable .iso and .bin/.cue build of your game.

### Instructions
Coming soon... this is a very early work in progress.
